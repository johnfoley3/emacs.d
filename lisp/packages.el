;; Sets up the packages config, including repos, and then requires package files and their config

;;; Code:
(unless (assoc-default "melpa" package-archives)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t))
(unless (assoc-default "org" package-archives)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") t))

(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))
(require 'use-package)

(setq load-prefer-newer t)

(add-hook 'after-init-hook
          (lambda ()
            (mapc (lambda (package-file) (load package-file))
      (directory-files (concat user-emacs-directory "packages/") t "^[^\.].*\.el$"))))

;; Sets up the packages config, including repos, and then requires package files and their config

;;; Code:
(require 'package) ;; You might already have this line
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"))
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/"))

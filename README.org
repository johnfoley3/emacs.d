* John's Emacs

Welcome! This is my Emacs configuration. It's super cool and useful. Plop it down in your home
folder or symlink it to that corresponding ~.emacs.d~ name and then start emacs. The ~use-package~
extension will take care of installing all of necessary packages.

You will need to insert your Paradox Github token. It must have public repo read access only

Much of this style and some code is taken from my good friend [[https://gitlab.com/azrazalea/emacs.d][Lily Carpenter's .emacs configuration]]
If you like the style and the code a lot, send her some love!
